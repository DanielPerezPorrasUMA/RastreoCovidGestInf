# "RastreoCovid"

This repository was used for a project for subject "Gestión de la Información" (Information Management) during my Software Engineering studies at University of Málaga
to demonstrate how to use SQLite databases stored locally on Android devices.

It consists of a simple Android app where the user is given a list of names and, for each of those names, they can add other names as "friends" in the context of tracking
COVID-19 (or any infectious disease) cases.
